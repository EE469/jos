1. Using separate handlers for different types of interrupts helps us tell apart the events causing these interrupts and respond to them in the right way

2. No, When the softint code tries to use int $14, it's working under user privileges (DPL 3), 
but the interrupt handler it attempts to call is set for kernel privileges only (DPL 0) in the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT). 
Therefore, the attempt to execute int $14 triggers a general protection fault instead, because the code lacks the necessary permissions for this operation.
